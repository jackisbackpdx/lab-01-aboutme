                <h2>Green Sturgeon</h2>
                <p class="aboutAnimal">
                        Sturgeon are modern relics of the ancient group of bony fishes,
                        though their skeleton consists of mostly cartilage rather than bone.
                        These long-lived fish have rows of bony plates, called “scutes”, instead
                        of scales for protection. The sturgeon has a shovel-like snout and vacuum 
                        cleaner-like mouth that it uses to siphon food from the river-bottom.
                        The green sturgeon spends the most time in saltwater of any of the three sturgeon
                        species that live part of their lives in the ocean, spending the majority of their
                        time in river estuaries and in the ocean. During the marine phases of green sturgeon’s
                        lives they feed on small, bottom-dwelling marine creatures, such as shrimp, shellfish,
                        and amphipods. When a green sturgeon reaches maturity at around 15 years of age, it will 
                        return to freshwater streams every 2-5 years to spawn in large, deep pools.
                        This cycle continues for the rest of the sturgeon’s life.

                <h2>Sea Otter</h2>
                <p class="aboutAnimal">
                        The sea otter is the largest member of the Mustelidae (weasel) family, 
                        and the smallest species of marine mammal in North America. Unlike other
                        marine mammals, sea otters have no layer of blubber and thus rely on their
                        dense fur for insulation from cold ocean waters. Their fur ranges from 
                        dark brown to reddish brown, and they have long lighter-colored whiskers.
                        Their forepaws have claws, are padded and are used for grooming and feeding.
                        Their hind feet are flipper like and used for swimming. Males are generally 
                        larger than females, and reach sexual maturity around five or six years of age,
                        while females can be sexually mature by age four.

                <h2>Coho Salmon</h2>
                <p class="aboutAnimal">
                        Coho salmon are one of seven salmon species native to the Pacific Ocean.
                        All salmon, including coho, are anadromous, meaning they spend part of
                        their lives in the ocean and part in freshwater. Oregon coho salmon begin
                        their lives far up our state’s rivers and streams eating small insects
                        and plankton, and once they are big enough they travel downstream to coastal
                        waters. There, they spend 2-3 years feeding on a variety of smaller fishes.
